# ColorHelper 1.2.0

## New

- Color preview will now show transparent colors with and without transparency.
- Transparent colors can now be stored and showed in palettes.
- Specifying files for scanning has been reworked and is now more flexible.  Read docs for more info.
- Color Helper no longer has preferred formats when inserting.  It will always prompt the user for their desired input format.
- Added CSS4's `rebeccapurple` to the `webcolor` names.
- Added better `rgb` and `rgba` support: percentage format, decimal format (CSS4), percentage alpha (CSS4).
- Added support for alpha channel as percentage for `hsla` (CSS4).
- Clamp color channel values out of range.
- Support CSS4 `gray`, `hwb`, and hex values with alpha channels.
- Option to read hex with alpha channel as `#AARRGGBB` instead of `#RRGGBBAA`.
- Option to compress hex values if possible on output: `#334455` --> `#345`.
- Can disable auto-popups if desired.
- Insert options now are now more dynamic and only show valid options for the current view.
- Anything else I might have missed.
