# ColorHelper 2.1.0

If you experience issues after the upgrade, check 
`Preferences->Package Settings->ColorHelper->Support Info` and see if you have 
mdpopups 1.9.3 installed.  If you do not, run Package Control's `Satisfy 
Dependency command.

This release mainly contains some bug fixes, and the migration of panel 
formatting to external template files (which is why we need mdpopups 1.9.3).

See `Preferences->Package Settings->ColorHelper->Changelog` for more info on 
the release.
