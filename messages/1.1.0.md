# ColorHelper 1.1.0

## New

- Color picker built into the tooltips (optionally can be overridden with ColorPicker Package's color picker).  See documentation for more info.
- Graphic sizes are now configurable in settings.
- Color tooltip used to popup up when a user started to type a color, cut would stay open even when the user ignored it.  Now it will auto close in this scenario.
- Settings are accessible via `Preferences->Package Settings->ColorHelper` in the menu.
- Support for the SCSS package added.
