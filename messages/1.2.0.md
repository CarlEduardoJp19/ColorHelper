# ColorHelper 1.2.0

## New

- Color picker will appear in palette panel if no color info panel is
allowed.
- Added "supported_syntax_incomplete_only" for incomplete colors that
may not yet be scoped within a valid scope due to being incomplete.
- In the color picker, instead of the select link, you now must choose the css format to insert via the corresponding `>>>` link.
- Add alternate rectangular color picker look.  You can use the new form by disabling the hex color picker look via the `use_hex_color_picker` setting.

## Fixes

- When manually forcing the popup via the command palette, the tooltip was getting closed.  ColorHelper is now aware of manual and auto popup tooltips and will only auto close the auto popups when ignored while typing.
